Git simplified or GITS was created to streamline and automate typical Git workflows. Even while GITS has many useful features, there are several places where upgrades and enhancements may make it even easier to use and more efficient. In this essay, we will examine the difficulties users of GITS have and suggest changes that could enhance its functionality and usefulness.

**Challenges and Improvements**

_1) Uniformity and consistency of command names:_

The challenge that we faced was that GITS adds its own set of commands, some of which have names that differ from those of conventional Git commands. Additionally, there is an inconsistency between commands while passing arguments. For instance, the branch is passed as **--branch** in the **gits pull** command whereas in **gits create** it is passed as **-b**. Moreover, unclear terms like **--name** have been used to refer to the repository in the **gits super-reset** command.

The names of commands must be consistent and known to the Git users. For users who have prior familiarity with Git, it will be easier to migrate to GITS if GITS command names are as consistent as feasible with their Git equivalents. We intend to solve this problem by using **-b** to pass branch as an argument. Additionally, the argument **--name** can be replaced by **--repo_name** to provide more clarity.

_2) Python Version Compatibility:_

Python is used throughout the GITS installation process, however the project does not state which version of Python is necessary. Version conflicts during installation may result from the absence of version compatibility information.

The compatible Python version(s) should be explicitly stated in GITS in order to enable a seamless installation experience. Users will be able to reduce potential issues by making sure they have the correct Python version installed with the help of this information. Version management might be facilitated by the use of tools like **pyenv**. We plan to solve this problem by providing a brief installation guide for **pyenv** in the README.md file.

_3) Documentation in its entirety:_

Despite the fact that GITS provides a variety of functionalities, several commands, such **gits logging** lack specialized documentation. It could be difficult for users to comprehend and use these commands correctly. Moreover, commands to push the branch from the local repository to the remote repository is also missing. This is one of the most important commands to push your newly created local branch to the repository and create a pull request to merge changes to your main branch.

GITS should include thorough documentation for each command to properly empower users. This documentation ought to offer thorough justifications, usage examples, and prospective applications. Every command should have its own page in the documentation so that users can utilize GITS to its fullest. We plan to add the documentation for the missing commands to solve this problem.

_4) Compatibility with Windows:_

GITS's compatibility with Windows 10 is now constrained by the need for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which is a challenge. For users of earlier versions of Windows or those who prefer not to utilize WSL, this can be a considerable difficulty.

GITS will become more accessible by extending its compatibility to earlier versions of Windows or by offering substitutes for Windows users who cannot or do not wish to use WSL. Expanding the selection of installation alternatives will increase the user base for GITS.

_5) Feedback Mechanism:_

There is no obvious way for users to give feedback or report difficulties when they experience them or when they have suggestions for enhancing GITS.

An organized feedback mechanism, like a forum or issue tracker, can be implemented to encourage user interaction and give users a way to aid in the development of GITS. The project team can utilize this to prioritize improvements based on user feedback and find areas for improvement.

_6)Version control and release control:_

GITS development may necessitate frequent updates and modifications. It may be difficult for users to stay up to date on updates and new releases. Currently no information about features added or bugs resolved during a release is present in the repository.

We could use practices of version control and release management such as semantic versioning, release notes, and version-specific documentation.

_7)Running manual tests:_

When running tests manually, we encountered some module import error. There is no documentation explaining how to run the test cases.

We need clear and detailed documentation explaining how to run test cases manually. We plan to add this documentation and a list of test cases that have been implemented by the previous contributors amd troubleshoot the errors that we have encountered.
